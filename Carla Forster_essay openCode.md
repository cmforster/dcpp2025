# Commoning Digital Public Infrastructures - Why openCode.de should be opened to the contributions of citizens

OpenCode is a platform hosted by the German ZenDiS (Center for Digital Sovereignty), which was initiated 2022 by the Ministry for the Interior on the basis of its establishment in [Germany’s Digital Strategy](https://www.bmv.de/SharedDocs/DE/Anlage/K/presse/063-digitalstrategie.pdf). OpenCode was initiated by the [German federal IT planning council](https://www.digitale-verwaltung.de/SharedDocs/interviews/Webs/DV/DE/2025/leonhard-kugler-interview.html) and is a [central project](https://www.publicplan.de/blog/ohne-open-source-keine-digitale-souveranitat) in Germany’s [aim for digital sovereignty](https://bmds.bund.de/themen/digitale-souveraenitaet). It allows public service entities to share code online alongside collaborating on these projects and exchanging knowledge in its [forum](https://discourse.opencode.de/). ZenDiS took on openCode in [January 2024](https://www.digitale-verwaltung.de/SharedDocs/interviews/Webs/DV/DE/2025/leonhard-kugler-interview.html) and hosts it alongside [openDesk](https://www.zendis.de/unser-angebot), their open source alternative to Microsoft Office. OpenCode therefore provides an option for collaborating on code alternative to the popular proprietary platform [GitHub](https://github.com/), owned by US-based Microsoft, which is particularly important considering current geopolitical tensions between Europe and the US. 

OpenCode is a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) – meaning the infrastructure necessary for a modern digital society, usually provided by states, for the public good. This brief proposes to make the first step to develop openCode towards a digital common – an open, shared digital resource governed by a community – through allowing citizen contributions on the public service code projects on it. This brief argues, in this order, why this move is normatively important, that it would accelerate German public service innovation at relatively little direct state cost, that it would improve openCode’s long term sustainability, and that it would support the ZenDiS’ existing goals. 

## How can integrating citizen contributions make openCode better?
### Normative reasons
Opening openCode would be a positive normative development in terms of democratising public services and citizen participation. 'Commoning' the platform would be a normative shift very much in line with Germany's political commitments on the digital transformation - Germany's [Digital strategy](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/service/archive/the-digital-strategy-of-the-german-government-1550216) states "positive progress can only be made if digital transformation is strongly anchored in society", which should include people being able to actively contribute to this transformation. Key ZenDiS officials emphasise that all members of the public service being able to participate in order for the digital transformation to be successful - but citizens, the users who depend on these services and their transformation daily, should have a say too.

### Public Service Innovation
This ties in with public service innovation: Allowing citizen contributions would be a milestone in German public service innovation and help the country to improve its [notoriously bureaucratic](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41358-025-00424-x) public administration. Permitting those using the system to make improvements to it is a step closer to a state and public administration that works better for everyone, and has the potential to improve public services greatly at relatively little direct effort and cost for the state itself. Crowdsourcing ideas like this is a promising way to increase the speed of innovation in the public sector.

### Improving long-term sustainability
Additionally, opening up the platform and moving it towards a digital common funded by the public is an opportunity to combine the best of both public service and the commons community to achieve an open, democratically governed platform that has stable funding. This funding is a problem independent commons [frequently grapple with](https://commons.ngi.eu/2024/11/14/digital-commons-as-providers-of-public-digital-infrastructures), while relying entirely on the government makes initiatives vulnerable to a shift in political priorities, whose implications on funding availability would have [significant impacts](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/critical-dependencies-power-consolidation-of-digital-infrastructures/) – if all maintainers and users of a project rely on state funding rather than the intrinsic motivation and community-driven development true digital commons like Linux rely on, they are very vulnerable to this. Integrating the platform deeper in Germany’s [big and active open source culture](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Open%20Source%20Software%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report%20-%20Germany.docx.pdf) is a way to allow the establishment of long-term structures keep it active even if political priorities shift. 

### Supporting the ZenDiS' existing goals
With the new Digital Ministry and the establishment of ZenDiS, Germany has intensified efforts on digitalisation in general and the implementation of open source principles in the public service in particular. ZenDiS was founded in part with the idea to make it the German public services’s Open Source Programme Office (OSPO) – the central unit in an organisation responsible for Open Source. After making improvements ot the platform itself, the current focus lies on developing openCode from a code archive to a platform for actively joint development of public service software solutions. The bigger mission is to effect a cultural change towards [open source principles](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/open-source-culture-9-core-principles-and-values) like collective efforts and an open exchange culture in the German public service. Allowing citizens this access, too, is a step towards promoting this culture in- and outside the public service, drawing increased attention to the initiative on both sides (especially if appropriately accompanied by a public campaign). 


## Practical limitations and pathways to implementation
Realistically, opening openCode is a long-term rather than a short-term goal, which is why this initiative is not currently part of ZenDiS' programme. In order to make the change practically feasible, a structured pilot programme in selected communities is recommended to test the viability of opening the platform and practical aspects. While some individuals have high technical skills, the average skill level is certainly insufficient to contribute to coding solutions, with only [49% of Germans having basic digital competences](https://initiatived21.de/publikationen/d21-digital-index/2024-25/executive-summary). An ambitious rollout of this change could include a community programme where engaged citizens with less and more technical skills work together at the local level to develop solutions to their grievances with Germany's digital public services. Naturally, some projects on openCode are of a more sensitive nature and security must be considered. OpenCode can take inspiration from other big open source projects like the Linux foundation or Wikipedia, where certain more experienced community members need to approve others’ contributions before they are integrated into the project to allow for some level of oversight.

Overall, commoning openCode further through integrating the wider community should be one of ZenDiS' long term goals and be adequately prepared through a pilot programme. It has the potential to act as catalyser for innovation and drastically improve public services for those who use them. This is an opportunity for participation in the digital transformation that should not be missed.
